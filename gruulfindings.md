## Gruul
Combat start: 02:46:47.536
### Grow
timestamps:
- 02:47:17.919
- 02:47:48.208
- 02:48:18.454
- 02:48:55.997

- 30.383s
- 30.289s
- 30.246s
- 37.543s (might be due to delays of 8sish by ground slam)

### Reverberation
timestamps:
- 02:48:35.405
- not enough information

relative time from last cast:


**final timer**: old

### Hurtful strike
timestamps:
- 02:46:53.309 SPELL_GO
- 02:46:56.950 SPELL_GO
- 02:47:03.398
- 02:47:13.079
- 02:47:21.555
- 02:47:44.565 SPELL_START

nothing really of worth to prove here. timer was 10s and 15s. likely it should be less then.


**final timer**: no change

timestamps:
- 02:47:22.762
- 02:48:45.074 

relative time from last cast:
- 35.226s start
- 82.312s 

existing timers seem quite close. not enough info to fine tune them.

**final timer**:

Shatter after:
timestamps:
- 02:47:32.458
- 02:48:54.782

time between slams and Shatter

- 02:47:15.499

- 02:47:55.470
- 02:48:03.139
- 02:48:03.949
- 02:48:12.409
- 02:48:20.873

relative time from last cast:
- 10.622s start
- 

timer generally doesn't seem to go down. I will leave it as is for now.
